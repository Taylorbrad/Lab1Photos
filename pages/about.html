     <h2> All about me! </h2>
     <p><br> My name is Jocilyn, but my friends know me as Jocie! I am a natural light, lifestyle photographer based out of Snowflake Arizona. I love to enjoy life with my husband and our three little kids, Aaron, Ellie & Rosie.<br><br> My passions include family, photography, singing, chocolate, making new friends, and spending time with old ones.<br><br>I started photographing people in 2012 & haven't stopped. I love to capture emotion and tell a story with images. Life is beautiful and I find joy capturing yours through my camera.<br><br>I'd love to meet you and take your photos! If you think we're a good fit, fill out the contact form below & I'll be in touch.<br><br>Thanks for visiting Mike Tyson Photography!<br><br> </p>
